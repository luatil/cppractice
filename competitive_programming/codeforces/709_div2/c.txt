n friends
m days
one teammate for each day

any friends can't be choose more than upper(m/2) times

1 <= n, m <= 100'000

4 friends and six days
4 6

1 1
2 1 2
3 1 2 3
4 1 2 3 4
2 2 3
1 3

This really feels like a graph problem. But i am not sure if it is.

A solution looks like 
for each day: 
1 2 3 4 5 6

1 2 1 1 2 3

And each is on the adj list of the day
and the total number of times it appears is not more than 3

So for days that only have a single friend it only makes sense to choose him

1 2 3 4 5 6 
1 x x x x 3

Brute force solution would look like 
For each of v[1] test all possible combinations of v[2:]

- At each point get the least used one(priority queue)
