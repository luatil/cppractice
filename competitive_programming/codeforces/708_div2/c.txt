n = 19
max_lcm = 8
1 8 8 

n = 21
max_lcm = 10
1 10 10

if n == odd
(1, (n-1)/2, (n-1)/2)

n = 20
2 9 9 // does not work because LCM is 18

n = 20
4 8 8 

n = 16
2 7 7  // nop
4 6 6 // does not work because LCM is 12
? 

n = 4
1 1 2

n = 6
4 1 1

n = 8
4 2 2

n = 16
8 4 4

n = 24
12 6 6

Therefore:

if n is odd:
    (1, (n-1)/2, (n-1)/2)
if n is even: 
    if n is a power of two 
        (n/2, n/4, n/4)
    (4, (n-4/2), n-4/2)
