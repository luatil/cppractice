So here I already came across a similar problem and know that for 
a 64 grid the answer is 32. You just put them in the dark squares and 
you don't attack each other. 

Oh, but the idea is count the ways two knights can be placed on a k*k such 
that they don't attach each other.

Having dp thoughts. 

Upper bound lower bound thinking. 

I think that an upper bound for n is going to be n * (n-8) / 2
Each knight can attack up to 8 squares, and so for each for each position you can 
put a knight over there. And another one on n-8 positions.

The problem is that not all knight attack 8 positions. If you place one in the corner
for instance it would only attack 2 squares. 

So I think that the total expression is of the form: 

k8 * (n-8) / 2 + k6(n-6) / 2 + k4 * (n-4) / 2 + k2 * (n-2) /2

sum(ki * (n-i)) for i in {2..8} /2 

Okay so k2 is going to be equal to 4 for any n > 2. You have four corners in each case. 
k3 = 8 for n >= 4
k4 is going to be equal to (n-4) * 4. plus some weird positions
k5
