3 4 8

Greedy 1:
Iterate over the maximum ticket price for each customer(bottom row). 
Pick the highest priced ticket that is below or equal the maximum price. 
Remove said ticket from the the available prices. 

For the above case this pairing would be 
{{3, 3}, {4, -1}, {8, 8}}

Consider the function MS, that measures the amount of pairings. We want to maximize 
MS. 

Feasibility: 
This does not give a not valid answer because you are removing the tickets
from the pool and are only picking tickets that are within your paying range. 
Therefore satisfying the problem constraints. 

Perhaps for the formal argument it is better to use a set of tickets and 
customers, with a function describing the price of said ticket and maximum
price the customer is willing to pay instead of using a multiset.
